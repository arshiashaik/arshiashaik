Hello, I am Arshia Shaik 🙋🏻‍♀️

I have over five years of experience in developing high-performance front-end applications, specializing in a range of cutting-edge technologies. My expertise spans across HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and JavaScript (including ES6 features like arrow functions, destructuring, promises, async/await, and modules), making me adept at building dynamic, responsive, and accessible web applications.

I have a strong command of the ReactJS framework, where I excel in creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) by leveraging components, JSX, the Virtual DOM, state management, and integration with RESTful APIs. Additionally, I'm skilled in developing responsive web designs using Bootstrap, CSS3 media queries, and flexbox, while also implementing reusable styling templates with SCSS for scalable and complex designs.

I'm well-versed in web accessibility standards, ensuring that my applications are inclusive for all users by adhering to WCAG guidelines and implementing ARIA roles, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation. My experience also extends to Angular, where I utilize TypeScript, reactive programming with RxJS, and component-based architecture to develop scalable applications.
